# Technologies Used:-

HTML: Structured the website with semantic elements for clarity and accessibility.

CSS: Applied modern styling techniques, including Flexbox and Grid, to create a visually appealing and responsive design.

PHP: Managed server-side logic and database interactions, ensuring efficient handling of user requests and data storage.

SQL: Executed queries to interact with the database, leveraging phpMyAdmin for database management.

JavaScript: Added interactivity, such as form validations and dynamic content updates, to enhance user engagement.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Challenges Faced
One of the primary challenges was ensuring data integrity and security during user inputs, particularly in forms for event submissions and notices. To address this, I implemented validation checks, sanitized inputs to protect against SQL injection, and ensured the accuracy of the information displayed in the application.
